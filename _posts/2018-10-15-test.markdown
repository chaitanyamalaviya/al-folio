Eso es uno testo

The problem has been this: while we were in PT, you were {not asking to hang out, usually not available when I asked, }
While we were away: {never once asked to skype/called, never talked about your emotions/tough time, replied after days,
                    when I was facing hard times, you weren't there (just said 'that sucks')}
when i tell you something, you don't take interest. will listen/watch later. no more inquiring about my life.

please be completely open and honest with me
share things with me more
be free, say what you feel
